# Tarot Reader Web App (Final Project)
This is the final project in OIM3650, by Eva Lee. please see [proposal.md](proposal.md), for the project proposal.

This project is a web application that allows users to access tarot readings and horoscope predictions. The app features tarot readings for love, career, and general advice as well as daily horoscope predictions.

## Features
Tarot readings are simulated with this website, as they are generated randomly from a deck of tarot cards based on the user's selection of love, career or general advice. Each tarot card has a unique meaning and interprestation, which is displayed to the user after they select the type of reaing they want.

The horoscope predictions are generated daily based on the user's zodiac sign, and from the inputed date of birth.

## Technologies Used
This web app was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Flask. The images were sourced from Google Images. The horoscope data is retrieved using a webscraper to scrape Horoscope.com. OpenAI API was also used for the interpretation of the Tarot Readings.

The web app is also hosted using Heroku.
