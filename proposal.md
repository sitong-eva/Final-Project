## Project Proposal
Due: 4/6/2023

<!-- The project proposal is worth 12% of the project grade.
Your proposal should contain seven parts, as specified below. The document need not be very long, but the more detail you include, the better feedback we can provide for your team: -->

<!-- The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.
Learning Objectives: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.
Implementation Plan: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.
Project Schedule: You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Draft a general timeline for your project. Depending on your project, you might be able to provide a detailed schedule or only an overview. Preparation of a longer project is also accompanied by present uncertainty, and this schedule will likely require revisions as the project progresses.
Collaboration Plan: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.
Risks and Limitations: What do you believe is the most significant threat to this project's success?
Additional Course Content: What topics do you believe will be beneficial to your project?
The proposal must be written using markdown format. We recommend checking out https://markdown-it.github.io if you need more help with markdown syntax. You need to commit and push this proposal to your project GitHub repository. Everyone needs to submit the URL of the proposal to Canvas for grading purposes.

You should also come to class with a printed version of this proposal. We will have about 10 minutes to meet with each team. You should designate one of the two team members to take notes.

### Part 1: The Big Idea

The main idea for my project is to write a web application that is able to predict the user's fate using tarot. The orginal problem that I am trying to solve is that it's difficult to learn how to perform tarot readings and to interpret the cards/signs accurately. By creating this web application, we're able to get our tarot readings quickly and easily, without having to learn how to do it or pay another individual to do it.

The MVP is a web application that uses the tarot API to get information from the user and also to produce an output that tells the user their fate. The web application would have radio buttons that ask the user for what category they are looking to get a reading for, and also their personal information for a more accurate reading. A far-stretched is goal is to create a very visually-pleasing website that targets mostly young women ages 16-25 that have an interest in tarot readings.

The topics that I will explore and accomplish are (1) using Tarot API and exploring functionalities, (2) front-end design and more familiarity with CSS/HTML, (3) overall more familiarity with full stack development - building a web app that incorporates both front-end and back-end functionality.


### Part 2: Learning Objectives

My learning goals include:\
    1. Full-stack development - connecting the front-end to the back-end to ensure everything works.\
    2. Learning how to create a more visually pleasing website, with more functions and interactions to serve the user's needs. For example, the user might want to have a tarot reading in the category of "Career", and they would be able to choose this category and get a reading that is more fitting to this category. Also making the website fitting to the target audience of young women.\
    3. Getting better at creating test cases for code and also debugging, by setting up breakpoints in my code.


### Part 3: Implementation Plan

My implementation plan includes using the following:
1. Tarot reading
    - APIs and libraries
         - https://github.com/ekelen/tarot-api\
         - ChatGPT/OpenAI API

2. Web app/final product
      - Using Flask, HTML/CSS
      - Testing the fucntionalities for website with friends and family

### Part 5: Collaboration Plan

This project will be an individual project where I will be completing all of the tasks alone, but I will ask for help from others as needed. In addition, I plan on using some version of Agile, where I will be preaking down the project into smaller phases, and also smaller tasks within those phases, to ensure consistent efforts to complete the project. (The project schedule and phases can be seen above in part 4). The reason why I picked this specific organizational structure is to ensure that I am completing the work incrementally so that progress is made throughout the timeframe, as opposed to leaving it all for the night before the deadline.

### Part 6: Risks and Limitations

The challenges that I most anticipate with this project are:
1. Front-end doesn't connect to back-end/coding progress taking too long
    - Due to a variety of reasons, it could end up taking me longer than anticipated to complete the coding Tarot Reading phase of this project.
    - A couple of ways of mitigating this:
      - Unresolved coding problems
        - Using Stack Overflow for potential solutions
        - Going to Office Hour with Prof to ask for help
        - Using ChatGPT
      - Saving time later on by simplifying design of website
2. Poor design
    - Creating a web app that only makes sense to me, and not to others.
    - To solve this issue, I will ask friends and family for feedback to ensure that the web app has a user friendly design that will not discourage people from using it.
3. Accuracy and effectiveness of tarot readings
    - Because this is an online tarot reading conducted by a computer, it might not be as accurate, thus defeating the purpose of having this web app.
    - To mitigate this problem, it's important to add a disclaimer in the website that this is for fun only not to be taken seriously.

### Part 7: Additional Course Content
The topics that I believe will be most beneficial are:
1. The whole first half of the class covering the basics of Python
    - I imagine that I will be using if/else statements, forloops, indexing, and methods and will be handling lists and dictionaries.
2. APIs
    - I will be using APIs to get data, and so the topic of API will be most beneficial as I recall how to use APIs.
3. Flask (HTML/CSS)
    - I will be building a Flask web app and using HTML and CSS to format and clean it up to make it more visually-pleasing, and so this topic will be especially beneficially for me as I make the web app.
