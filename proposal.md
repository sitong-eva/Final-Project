## Project Proposal
Due: 4/6/2023

The project proposal is worth 12% of the project grade.
Your proposal should contain seven parts, as specified below. The document need not be very long, but the more detail you include, the better feedback we can provide for your team:

The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.
Learning Objectives: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.
Implementation Plan: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.
Project Schedule: You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Draft a general timeline for your project. Depending on your project, you might be able to provide a detailed schedule or only an overview. Preparation of a longer project is also accompanied by present uncertainty, and this schedule will likely require revisions as the project progresses.
Collaboration Plan: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.
Risks and Limitations: What do you believe is the most significant threat to this project's success?
Additional Course Content: What topics do you believe will be beneficial to your project?
The proposal must be written using markdown format. We recommend checking out https://markdown-it.github.io if you need more help with markdown syntax. You need to commit and push this proposal to your project GitHub repository. Everyone needs to submit the URL of the proposal to Canvas for grading purposes.

You should also come to class with a printed version of this proposal. We will have about 10 minutes to meet with each team. You should designate one of the two team members to take notes.

### Part 1: The Big Idea

The main idea of my project is to create a Websscraper for bank websites to see whether the bank institution offers mortgages and the contact associatied to assist a Babson professor on campus with his research about mortgage disparities.

The topics that I will explore and accomplish are (1) webscraping, (2) using a combination of libraries and APIs, (3) more familiarity with HTML/CSS.

The MVP is a Webscraper bot that will be able to obtain information about banking institution. Ideally, the stretch goal would be to create a visually appealing website where if I input a bank's name or website, the website will return an output that tells whether this bank offers mortages, and the contact for obtaining the mortgage. Or if I upload a list of bank institutions in an Excel file, the website will return an output of an Excel file with information on all the banks in the list that is available for download.

### Part 2: Learning Objectives

My learning goals include:
    1. Learning how to create a webscraper using Beautiful Soup, and improving upon it using ChatGPT and OpenAI API.\
        - Learning more about the contents within a website, and how does a webscraper bot scrape it.\
    2. Learning how to create a more visually pleasing website, with more functions and interactions, such as uploading/downloading.\
    3. Getting better at creating test cases for code and also debugging.

### Part 3: Implementation Plan

My implementation plan includes the following:
    1. APIs and libraries\
        - Beautiful Soup\
        - ChatGPT/OpenAI API
